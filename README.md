# Loan-Status-Prediction-Model

## **Background**
In the financial sector, assessing loan status is crucial for risk management and decision-making processes. Traditional methods often involve manual evaluation, which can be time-consuming and prone to human error. Utilizing machine learning models can streamline this process by automating loan status predictions based on various applicant features.

## **Problem Statement**
The objective is to develop robust machine learning models capable of accurately predicting loan status based on applicant information. This will facilitate quicker and more objective decision-making for loan approvals.

## **Goals**

1. Build SVM, Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression (LogReg), and Random Forest classifiers for loan status prediction.

2. Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics to assess model performance.

3. Optimize each model to ensure generalizability and robustness.

4. Determine the best-performing model for loan status prediction.

## **Dataset**
